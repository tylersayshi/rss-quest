# RSS Quest

A search engine for blogs from RSS feeds.

Googling for tech blogs is hard. This is a statically generated indexing site for searching for tech blogs.

Feeds and posts infrequently changed, so I've set this up to be a static index that will be stored in your browser for near instant search speeds locally.

As the search set grows I may adjust this, but for now, it's quite fast and nice. Give it a try!
